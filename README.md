# The-23-2KGamesPackCap
These are Packet Captures of WWE2k23 and NBA2K23

This Repo is used for Educational Purposes as it learns the structure of Network routes of Services operated via two games that, as of recently, has been terminated until further notice. Fair Note, for NBA2K23, I have only focus on the "MyPark" routing operation as it's, in my opinion, most popular than MyTeam and PlayNowOnline. For WWE2K23, I went via everything I have focus to analyze, however the complete duration of process will probably skimmed via my memory so what I have posted is you can work with.
